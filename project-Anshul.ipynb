This credit is from a state program that requires power plants, natural gas providers, and other large industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy carbon pollution permits. The credit on your bill is your share of the payments from the State\\'s program.\\n\\n> The Climate Credit is one of many programs resulting from landmark legislation called the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. Together, these programs are cutting pollution, creating jobs, and investing in cleaner energy and transportation. Your Climate Credit is designed to help you join in these efforts.

The most worrisome part about it is people try to push her forward as a hero. In reality it’s because “you’re a bad person if you argue with an autistic teenage girl”. The girl had absolutely no clue what she was talking about, sounded almost like a North Korean describing Kim Jong Un in how over the top and fanatical she was. \\n\\nDon’t get me wrong I think climate change is real, (debate for another time) but people like Greta are utter morons. The earth isn’t gonna end in 10 years, wind and solar arent the solutions, making a carbon fiber boat for a single trip (somehow eco friendly....?) isn’t a solution, skipping school isn’t a solution, making up shit isn’t a solution, and being a bitch about it sure as hell isn’t. \\n\\nIf liberals were serious about combatting climate change, they’d focus on nuclear, natural gas, and carbon capture. Not the inefficient, costly [steel behemoths ](https://t.co/Oo20WYmkAZ) that windmills are, nor the land destroying, lithium-battery reliant splotches solar farms are.\\n\\nThere are lots of solutions to climate change that would both work and be cost effective, sadly no one seems to actually care for working on real solutions. Rather “climate activists” circle jerk to their fantasies of massive lithium mines, 10x current power costs, becoming wholly reliant on the middle east and china (great environmental records there), more massive CO2 pumping monstrosities that steel plants are, and imprisoning oil executives that are responsible for the power that made and charged the phones they bitch on.',\n",

Im not saying that It's going to end up destroying the world in a year either. I'm saying that when there is so much debate on something like this, where there are two very large sides debating it back and forth (especially when its about the fate of the planet and obviously us within it), I believe the truth is somewhere in between.
