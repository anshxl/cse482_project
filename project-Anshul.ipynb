      "Self-Text: I'm a democrat, and before last night I believed that with all the people coming out to vote who hadn't before, we would see Biden winning by a significant margin. To my surprise, obviously that didn't happen and a very significant portion of the country really believes in Trump apparently. I don't agree with any of his policies, and to put it lightly, I'm not a fan of his character. As a result of that, I genuinely don't understand what it is about him that compels someone to vote for him. \n",
      "\n",
      "But, the thing that I'm most tired of is the massive bipartisan divide in this country that has caused so much hostility from both sides, and I think the first step to improving the situation is to make a real effort to understand each other. So, if some of you would take the time to help me understand why you believe in Trump, I would appreciate it. Thanks.\n",
